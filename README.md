# Homura

A functional programming language with algebraic effects and effect handlers. Most of the features, especially the ones about the effect system, are adapted from [*Eff*](https://www.eff-lang.org/), see https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2334.

This toy language is named after the heroine of TV anime Puella Magi Madoka Magica.
